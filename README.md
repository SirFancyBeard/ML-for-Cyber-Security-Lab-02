# ML-for-Cyber-Security-Lab-02
This repository contains the files for Lab 2 of the aforementioned course.

The IPython Notebook can be run like any standard program of its kind. It generates models for the distinct thresholds specified in the assignment for the repaired networks. I have uploaded the repaired networks too so that evaluating it is a simple plug-and-play operation.

Should one run the program, it is worthwile to note that these same models for repairing the network shall be created and saved in the file explorer on their programming environment. The files shall not get downloaded to the local machine automatically.
